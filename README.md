# RGB Switch
This is a pretty basic RGB Switch design based on CBT3244AD bus switch ICs, SH1106 IÂ²C screen, MAX7461 Loss-of-Sync detector IC and ATmega328p microcontroller.
File that contains XBM images (*xbm.h*) is not included due to possible copyright issues I don't want to deal with.
You can find more examples of screen functionality in *extra/pictures*
