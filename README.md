# RGB Switch
This is a pretty basic RGB Switch design based on CBT3244AD bus switch ICs, SH1106 I²C screen and ATmega328p microcontroller.

Uses hardware-accelerated I2C **[library](https://github.com/jeremycole/avr)** by [Jeremy Cole](https://github.com/jeremycole) and **[u8g2 library](https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2)** by [olikraus](https://github.com/olikraus)
